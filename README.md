# datacamp-funcmanidata-sql

This course provided an understanding of how to use built-in PostgreSQL functions in SQL queries to manipulate different types of data including strings, character, numeric and date/time. We traveled back to a time where Blockbuster video stores were on every corner and if you wanted to watch a movie, you actually had to leave your house to rent a DVD! I also got an introduction into the robust full-text search capabilities which provides a powerful tool for indexing and matching keywords in a PostgreSQL document. And finally, I learned how to extend these features by using PostgreSQL extensions.
